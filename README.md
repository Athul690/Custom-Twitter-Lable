How to Change the Twitter Source Label
1. To create your own Twitter app, navigate to the Twitter Developer website, and log in with your Twitter account by clicking on the sign-in button at the top right

2. Then click on the Developer Portal option beside it

3. On the next page, fill out the form with details such as your use case, resident country, etc. This process may take like 10 minutes but you will get a verification email instantly once you submitted the form.

4. Click on the Confirm your email button in the email sent from Twitter Developer Accounts. Once done, you will be redirected to the Twitter developer page again.

6. Now scroll down to the Standalone Apps section and click on Create App.

7. Give your app a name; remember that this name will be shown on your tweets as a source label. You cannot name your app with an existing name like Twitter for Android or a name that is being used by another app. So give it a unique name and click Next at the bottom of the page.

8. Now you will see your newly created appâ€™s APIs under Keys & Tokens. Just click on App settings at the bottom right to make a few tweaks to your app.

14. Just click on the Regenerate and Generate buttons respectively to create a fresh API key, API Key Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret. Copy and save these 4 keys aside as they will be useful later.

15. Now you have access to Twitter APIs. To create a Twitter app, you need to download Python. Open the Python website and download the python for your OS.
