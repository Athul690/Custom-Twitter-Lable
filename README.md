# Custom-Twitter-Lable
This app Will change your Twitter lables like 'Twitter for Android ' or Twitter for iphone' to any custom Lable
Any tweet made from a custom application made through the twitter developer console will show the same name you gave the app when making the app , we can use this feature to show any thing as we wish so if someone wants change 
To the name of there company they can do it, or if someone jest want to have some fun can do it 

In order for this app to work you need to install tweepy on terminal
