How to Change the Twitter Source Label
1. To create your own Twitter app, navigate to the Twitter Developer website, and log in with your Twitter account by clicking on the sign-in button at the top right

2. Then click on the Developer Portal option beside it

3. On the next page, fill out the form with details such as your use case, resident country, etc. This process may take like 10 minutes but you will get a verification email instantly once you submitted the form.

4. Click on the Confirm your email button in the email sent from Twitter Developer Accounts. Once done, you will be redirected to the Twitter developer page again.
